# Payload encoder -decoder library assignment
In semester 6 of the Embedded Systems Engineering program, students focus on the Internet of Things (IoT). In this context, LoRaWAN technology is used to transmit data from the KISS LoRa device. The task is to develop a solution for the improvement of the encoding and decoding of the payloads used in this system.
